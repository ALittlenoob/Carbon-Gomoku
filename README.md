Gomoku game (Five in a Row) playing program with a really strong advanced artificial intelligence algorithm (evaluation function, mini-max with cut offs, aplha-beta, transposition table, situation signatures, candidate generating, expert knowledge, further enhancements). Very heavly documented in author's native language (polish) - see Documentation_PL folder.  The AI algorithm was really one of the strongest as for 2002 and it's also reasonable even now in 2015.
